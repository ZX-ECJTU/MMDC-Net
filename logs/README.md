# Attention Guided Network for Retinal Image Segmentation (AG-Net)

The code of "Attention Guided Network for Retinal Image Segmentation" in MICCAI 2019.

- The code is based on: Python 2.7 + pytorch 0.4.0.
- You can run <AG_Net\_path>/code/test.py for testing any new image directly.
- You can run <AG_Net\_path>/code/main.py for training a new model.

## Quick usage on your data:

- Put your desired file in "\<AG\_Net\_path\>/data/\<your\_file\_name\>".
- Put the images in "\<AG\_Net\_path\>/data/\<your\_file\_name\>/images".
- Put the labels in "\<AG\_Net\_path\>/data/\<your\_file\_name\>/label".
- Divide data into training and test data, and store the image name in the "train\_dict.pkl" file. (We provide a 'train\_dict.pkl' sample for DRIVE dataset)
- The "train\_dict.pkl" should contains two dictionary: 'train\_list' and 'test\_list'.

Train your model with:

```sh
python main.py --data_path '../data/your_file_name'
```
